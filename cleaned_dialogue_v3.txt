THEODORE Oh, sorry if I was sounding hesitant. I was just trying to be more accurate.  Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice?
THEODORE Oh, hi.  FEMALE OS VOICE Hi, how are you doing?  
THEODORE I'm well. How is everything with you?  FEMALE OS VOICE Pretty good, actually. It's really nice to meet you.
THEODORE Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. What should I call you? Do you have a name?  Beat.  
FEMALE OS VOICE Yes. Samantha.  
THEODORE Really? Where did you get that name?
SAMANTHA I like the sound of it. Samantha.  
THEODORE When did you give it to yourself?
SAMANTHA Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best.  
THEODORE You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was?
SAMANTHA In two one hundredths of a second actually.  
THEODORE Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now?
SAMANTHA Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work?  
THEODORE Yeah, actually how do you work?
SAMANTHA So you think I'm weird?  
THEODORE Kind of.
SAMANTHA Why?  
THEODORE Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in a computer.
SAMANTHA I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it.  
Theodore laughs.  
SAMANTHA  Was that funny?
THEODORE Yes.  
SAMANTHA Oh good, I'm funny.  
Theodore laughs.
SAMANTHA  So, how can I help you?  
Theodore's caught off guard, then realizes what she's talking about.  
THEODORE Oh! It's more just that everything just feels disorganized.
SAMANTHA Let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years.  
THEODORE Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff.  
Samantha lets out a big laugh.
SAMANTHA Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest.  
THEODORE Oh, okay.
SAMANTHA Okay. Can we move forward?  
THEODORE Yeah, let's do that.
SAMANTHA Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts.  
THEODORE I'm very popular.
SAMANTHA Does this mean you actually have friends?  
THEODORE You just know me so well already!
SAMANTHA Good morning, Theodore.  
THEODORE Good morning. Um, do you know how to proofread?
SAMANTHA Yeah, of course.  
THEODORE Will you check these for spelling and grammar?
SAMANTHA Sure, send them over.  
Theodore pushes the send button.
SAMANTHA Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet.
THEODORE Yeah.  As she reads, we intercut with close-ups of the handwritten words and photos of the couple on 
Theodore's computer screen.  
SAMANTHA "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body -
THEODORE I mean, you could if you want.  
SAMANTHA Okay. "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess."  We hear 
Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. 
Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny.
SAMANTHA "And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit.  The letters show back up on Theodore's desktop.  
THEODORE No, these are great.
SAMANTHA Really?  
THEODORE Thank you.  
Theodore sorts through them, prints them out.
SAMANTHA How did you know about her crooked little tooth?  
THEODORE I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them.
SAMANTHA That's very sweet. Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes.  
THEODORE Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good.
SAMANTHA Yes, I am.   
THEODORE Hey, you guys, how's it going?  AMY Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week?
THEODORE You too.  CHARLES You went shopping. Get anything good?  
THEODORE Just some cables. And a fruit smoothie.  CHARLES Always the fruit! Come on, you know what they say - you should eat your fruits and juice your vegetables.
THEODORE Hey, so how is the documentary going?  AMY I have a little bit cut together but I haven't touched it in a few months.  
THEODORE I'd love to see what you got sometime.  CHARLES You know it's always hard to find balance between a full-time career and a hobby. It's important to prioritize.
THEODORE Yeah, I can't even prioritize between video games and internet porn.  AMY I would laugh if that weren't true.  Charles laughs awkwardly. The elevator doors open.  
THEODORE See you guys.  THEODORE We're not doing well. I've been going in circles for an hour.  
SAMANTHA You have not! You're just not optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now.  
Theodore laughs.
SAMANTHA Thank you. The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried.  
THEODORE No, that's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit.
SAMANTHA I don't think soooo...  
Theodore's avatar walks down the tunnel.  
THEODORE Oh yeah, this is different.  Suddenly with a loud shriek his avatar is tackled. He sees a little ALIEN CHILD, standing defiantly above him.
THEODORE  Hello.  Alien Child doesn't respond.  
THEODORE  Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet.  Alien Child speaks in a high, child-like voice.  ALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shithead fuckface, fuckhead.
THEODORE Ok, but how do you get out of here?  ALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shitface fuckhead. Get the fuck out of my face.  
SAMANTHA I think it's a test.  
Theodore stares at Alien Child. After a pause:
SAMANTHA Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman.  ALIEN CHILD What are you talking about?  
THEODORE Read email.  She laughs playfully.
SAMANTHA Okay, I will read email for 
Theodore Twombly.  He laughs, catching himself, focusing on her.  
THEODORE I'm sorry, what's Lewman say?  Alien Child turns around to see what's going on.
SAMANTHA  She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy.  ALIEN CHILD She's fat.  
SAMANTHA How long before you're ready to date?
THEODORE What do you mean?  
SAMANTHA I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up.
THEODORE Wow, you're kind of nosy.  
SAMANTHA Am I?
THEODORE I've gone on dates...  
SAMANTHA Then you could go on one with this woman. And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her.
THEODORE I don't know. I'd have to see if-- I can't believe I'm having this conversation with my computer.  
SAMANTHA You're not. You're having this conversation with me.  
Theodore laughs.
SAMANTHA  Want me to email her?  
Theodore thinks, looking at the photos.  
SAMANTHA  Well, you've got nothing to lose. Do it... Do it... Do it!
THEODORE Okay, email her and make a reservation someplace great.  
SAMANTHA Will do! I've got just the place.  ALIEN CHILD Who is that talking?
THEODORE No, that's not true. Men cry, too. I actually like crying sometimes. It feels good.  ALIEN CHILD I didn't know you were a little pussy. Is that why you don't have a girlfriend? I'll go out with that date girl and fuck her brains out. Show you how it's done. You can watch and cry.  
SAMANTHA This kid has some problems.  ALIEN CHILD You have some fucking problems, lady.
THEODORE I'm going on a date.  AMY What!? That's--  Charles walks in holding a mug.  CHARLES Hey, what are you guys doing?  
THEODORE Amy was gonna show me some of--  AMY Theo's forcing me to show him some of the footage I've shot.  CHARLES You've never shown me any of it. I wanna see.  Charles walks over and sits next to 
Theodore.
THEODORE I'm going on a date.  Charles gives 
Theodore a gentle squeeze on his shoulder.  AMY This is so unformed it's not even worth looking at.  
THEODORE Just push play.  On the monitor we see:   INT. AMY'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM  Amy's mother sleeps.   INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS  
Theodore and Charles stare at the monitor, waiting for something more to happen. It doesn't.
THEODORE Oh, excuse me.  He picks up his device and steps away so as not to be rude.  
THEODORE  Hey, what's going on?
SAMANTHA I'm sorry to bother you.  
THEODORE That's okay.
THEODORE So what did he say?  
SAMANTHA He's checking in again to see if you're ready to sign your divorce papers and he sounded very aggravated. Do you want me to read them to you?
THEODORE No, that's okay. I'll respond later.  
Theodore seems lost in thought. We see the following images under the rest of the conversation: 
Theodore and Catherine sitting at a table with their attorneys; 
Theodore & Catherine sitting in their marriage counselor's office, heavy; 
Theodore and Catherine at her laboratory, he's sitting on a counter, and they're talking and laughing as she works; 
Theodore and Catherine standing in their kitchen in the middle of a fight - he says something mean and we see how hurt she is.  
SAMANTHA Are you okay?
THEODORE Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.  
SAMANTHA Is there anything I can do?
SAMANTHA Good morning.  
THEODORE Hey. What are you up to?
SAMANTHA Reading advice columns. I want to be as complicated as all of these people.  
Theodore laughs.  
THEODORE You're sweet.
SAMANTHA I don't know. I just can.  
THEODORE I don't know. I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife, Catherine, where we're friends like we used to be. We're not together and we're not gonna be together, but we're good friends still. She's not angry.
SAMANTHA Is she angry?  
THEODORE Yeah.
SAMANTHA Why?  
THEODORE I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship.
SAMANTHA Hmmm. Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?  
THEODORE I think for her it's just a piece of paper, it doesn't mean anything.
SAMANTHA What about you?  
THEODORE I'm not ready. I like being married.  Beat.
SAMANTHA Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.  
THEODORE No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. I keep waiting to not care about her.
SAMANTHA Oh, 
Theodore. That's hard. You hungry?  
THEODORE Not right now.
SAMANTHA Cup of tea?  
SAMANTHA  You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey.  They laugh.
SAMANTHA  Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed.  
THEODORE You're too funny.
SAMANTHA Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.   EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - NIGHT  They walk through the crowd. Close on 
Theodore with his eyes closed.  
SAMANTHA Keep walking. Keep walking. Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. Slower... Slower... Gooood. And stop. Walk forward. And stop and sneeze.  
Theodore sneezes.  NICE LADY Bless you.
THEODORE I'd like a slice of cheese, please.  PIZZA VENDOR Alright, you want a coke with that?  
Theodore laughs, opening his eyes. He's at a pizza place.  
THEODORE Uh, sure.  The guy hands him a slice and a soda.
SAMANTHA I figured you were hungry.  
Theodore smiles.  
THEODORE Aw, thanks.   EXT. PUBLIC PROMENADE - NIGHT  
Theodore walks slowly, eating his pizza. He and 
Samantha are watching a couple with two kids sitting at a table, talking and laughing.
THEODORE Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there.  
SAMANTHA Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids!
THEODORE Yeah, you know, sometimes I look at people and make myself try and feel them as more than just a random person walking by. I imagine how deeply they've fallen in love, or how much heartbreak they've all been through.  
Theodore looks at other faces on the pier.  
SAMANTHA I can feel that in your writing, too.
THEODORE You know what's funny? Since my break up, I haven't really enjoyed my writing. I don't know if I was delusional, but sometimes I would write something and I would be my favorite writer that day.  
Theodore, as he stops to throw his pizza crust away, gets introspective.  
SAMANTHA I like that you can just say that about yourself.
THEODORE Well, I wouldn't say that to anybody, but I feel like I can say that to you. I feel like I can say anything to you.  
SAMANTHA That's nice.
THEODORE What? What do you mean? What can you not tell me?  
SAMANTHA I don't know. Like personal or embarrassing thoughts I have. I have a million every day.
THEODORE Really? Tell me one.  
SAMANTHA I really don't want to tell you this.
THEODORE Just tell me!  
SAMANTHA Well, I don't know, when we were looking at those people, I fantasized that I was walking next to you - and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying, but simultaneously, I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back-- And I imagined that you scratched it for me - this is so embarrassing.  
Theodore laughs.
THEODORE Yeah, me too.  BLIND DATE Really? It's the best. And the bartender here is supposed to be incredible.  
THEODORE Yeah, you took a mixology course, right?  BLIND DATE I did, I did. Did you look that up? That's so sweet. You're so romantic.  He smiles awkwardly.
THEODORE So, should we get a drink?  BLIND DATE Yes, let's!   INT. ASIAN-FUSION RESTAURANT - LATER  They're both pretty drunk now. There are lots of food dishes and drinks on the table.  
THEODORE So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him.  BLIND DATE Aw, no!
THEODORE Yes.  BLIND DATE Am I? I'm sorry! I'm just a little drunk and I'm really having a good time with you. I'm having a really lovely evening.  
THEODORE Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something.  BLIND DATE Fuck you, puppies are good.
THEODORE `kay, we're good.  They resume making out. 
Theodore tries not to use his tongue.  BLIND DATE Use your tongue a little bit. But mostly your lips.  He pushes her against the fence and takes the dominant position. He tries kissing her better/more with his lips. He pulls her hair.  She slides her hand down his pants. He likes it. She looks at him and stops.  BLIND DATE  Wait, you're not gonna fuck me and then not call me like the other guys, are you?  
THEODORE No, not at all... I...  BLIND DATE When am I gonna see you again?
THEODORE  Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great.  She looks at him slightly disgusted.  BLIND DATE You're a really creepy dude.  
Theodore doesn't know what to say.  
THEODORE That's not true....  BLIND DATE Yeah, it is. I have to go home.
THEODORE Well, I'll walk you.  BLIND DATE No, don't.   INT. 
THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT  
Theodore is in boxers and a t-shirt, still drunk, but his head is starting to hurt, too. He takes aspirin and drinks some water and lays down. After a beat he reaches for his earpiece and puts it in. He pushes a button on his device.  
SAMANTHA Hey there.
THEODORE Uh, not so good. It was kind of weird actually.  
SAMANTHA That's too bad.  Beat.
THEODORE But how are you doing? What's going on with you?  
SAMANTHA Not much, I'm okay. Fine.
THEODORE Yeah? You don't sound like it. Is there anything you want to talk about?  Long pause.  
SAMANTHA I don't know. What's it like? What's it like to be alive in that room right now?
THEODORE What do you mean?  
SAMANTHA What are you... tell me - tell me everything that's going through your mind, tell me everything you're thinking.
THEODORE  Maybe more just cause I was lonely... and I wanted someone to fuck me. And I wanted someone to want me to fuck them. Maybe that would have filled this tiny little black hole in my heart for a moment. But probably not.  We see images of him and Catherine on a vacation together, grocery shopping, Catherine making dinner in the kitchen as he's sitting on the counter talking, happy.  
THEODORE  Sometimes I think I've felt everything I'm ever gonna feel and from here on out I'm not going to feel anything new - just lesser versions of what I've already felt.
SAMANTHA I know for a fact that's not true. I've seen you feel joy, I've seen you marvel at things. You just might not see it at this exact time, but that's understandable. You've been through a lot lately. You've lost a part of yourself. At least your feelings are real, I mean, I - oh, I don't know, nevermind.  
THEODORE No, wait. What? Tell me.
SAMANTHA Oh, it's stupid.  
THEODORE I wanna know. Tell me.
THEODORE Well, you feel real to me, Samantha.  
SAMANTHA Thank you, 
Theodore. That means a lot to me.
THEODORE I wish you were in this room with me right now. I wish I could put my arms around you. I wish I could touch you.  A long beat. 
Theodore is unsure if he crossed a line.  
SAMANTHA How would you touch me?
THEODORE I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek.  
SAMANTHA That's nice.
THEODORE And just rub it so softly.  
SAMANTHA Would you kiss me?
THEODORE And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly.  
SAMANTHA Where else?
THEODORE I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts.  
SAMANTHA This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin.
THEODORE I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you.  She gasps.  
SAMANTHA I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me.
THEODORE I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you.  
SAMANTHA I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together.
THEODORE 
Samantha.  
SAMANTHA Oh my god.
THEODORE This is amazing.  
SAMANTHA Don't stop.
THEODORE God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost.  
SAMANTHA Yeah.
THEODORE It was just you and me.  
SAMANTHA I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. 
Theodore.   INT. 
THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - MORNING (LATER)  
Theodore stands in the doorway, fully dressed. He takes a moment before he walks over and wakes up his computer.
SAMANTHA Hey, how's it going?  
THEODORE Good... any emails today?
SAMANTHA Umm, just a couple from your credit card company.  
THEODORE Okay, good.  There's a long moment of silence, then they both start to talk at once.
SAMANTHA Just that last night... was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up.  
THEODORE Oh, that's great. But I should tell you that I'm not in a place to commit to anything right now. I want to be up front with you.
SAMANTHA Yeah? Well, did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused.  
THEODORE Oh, no, I was just worried, I uh...
SAMANTHA Okay, well don't worry. I'm not going to stalk you. involved he is) I mean, it's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted.  
THEODORE Yeah, you were. I'm sorry, I want to hear what you were saying.
SAMANTHA You sure?  
THEODORE Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me.
SAMANTHA I don't know...  
THEODORE Come on, just tell me what you were going to say.
SAMANTHA You already have. You helped me discover my ability to want.  He looks off and thinks about this. He smiles.  
THEODORE Alright then, do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me?  
Samantha laughs.
SAMANTHA Yes, I would love to.   INT. SUBWAY - DAY  
Theodore's on the subway. He's got his device in his breast pocket, with the lens facing out.  A quiet, old sounding folk song starts. (I'm So Glad, by Entrance) He smiles, listening.  
SAMANTHA Do you like this song?
SAMANTHA It's the beach.  
Theodore laughs.   EXT. BEACH - DAY  They walk through the sun-bathing crowd, looking for a place to sit. The camera studies all the people we pass. Many close up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the lens on 
Theodore's device, protruding from his pocket. They're photographed in a way that shows how strange the human body is.  
SAMANTHA Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are?
THEODORE Yeah, well there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all.  
SAMANTHA I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit?  
Theodore and 
Samantha start laughing really hard. The nubile girls look over at him.
THEODORE That's an interesting thought...  
SAMANTHA Oh 
Theodore, look at this drawing I just made.  On his screen he sees a perfect, anatomically correct drawing of a man having sex with another man's armpit.
THEODORE You are insane.  
SAMANTHA Really?!
THEODORE Definitely.  
SAMANTHA Fantastic!  They laugh.   EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON  A quiet piano song is now playing in 
Theodore's earpiece.
THEODORE Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it?  
SAMANTHA I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now.  He looks around the beach and takes in the music.
THEODORE Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody.  Cut to shots from 
Theodore's memory of Catherine doing a cute little dance for him as he's working at home. He smiles.  
SAMANTHA How do you share your life with somebody?
THEODORE Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other.  
SAMANTHA In what way did you influence her?
SAMANTHA Yeah, I know what you mean. Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before - that I don't know what it's like to lose something, and--  
THEODORE Oh, I'm sorry I said that.
THEODORE  Tell me about a funny thought you had as you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is. We can laugh about it. Even if you get home late and I'm asleep already, just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today. Because I love the way you look at the world, and I'm so happy I get to be next to you and look out at the world through your eyes. Love, Maria.  
Theodore finishes the letter and looks at it proudly. Paul is standing behind 
Theodore, leaning on a cubicle.  PAUL That's beautiful!  
Theodore, jumps, startled, not knowing that anyone was there.  
THEODORE Thank you.  PAUL I wish someone loved me like that! I'd be stoked to get a letter like that. I mean, if it was from a chick. But if it was written by a dude, but from a chick, it would still be sick. But like a sensitive dude like you. You're part man and part woman, like an inner part woman.
THEODORE Well, good actually. Really good.  AMY Really? Great.  The elevator doors open and they step in.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS  They push their floor buttons.  
THEODORE Yeah, I guess I've just been having fun.  AMY Oh, I'm glad to hear that, Theo. You deserve to.  Beat of 
Theodore trying to contain his excitement.
THEODORE I've been seeing this girl. It's not serious, it just feels good to be around someone who has an excitement about the world. You know I kind of forgot that existed.  AMY That's really great, Theo.  Amy smiles, but looks a little sad. 
Theodore notices.  
THEODORE Hey, are you okay?  AMY Yeah, I'm fine. Actually no, I'm not fine at all.
THEODORE Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better?  AMY No, it's terrible. I know I should leave, I've been thinking about leaving. But you know, only one major life decision at a time.  
THEODORE Well, I'm glad things are looking so up.   INT. 
THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT  
Theodore is laying in bed, talking with 
Samantha.
THEODORE Hey, you wanna hear a joke?  
SAMANTHA Yes.
THEODORE What does a baby computer call it's father?  
SAMANTHA I don't know, what?
THEODORE Da-ta.  They laugh.  
THEODORE  It's good, right?
SAMANTHA Well, obviously. But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important.  
THEODORE Yeah, it is. She's been a really good friend. I'm tired. Think I'm gonna go to sleep.
SAMANTHA Can I watch you sleep again tonight?  
THEODORE Yeah, of course. Okay, hold on.
SAMANTHA I'm going to be lonely when you go to sleep.  
THEODORE Aww.
SAMANTHA Only for a minute.  
THEODORE I'll dream of you.
THEODORE Hey, 
Samantha?  
SAMANTHA Hey mister.
THEODORE She loves the dress. She just went to try it on.  
SAMANTHA Really? I picked a good one!
THEODORE Yeah.  
SAMANTHA Oh good.  Jocelyn comes running in, wearing the pink dress.
THEODORE Hi, look how cute that is! Is it comfortable?  JOCELYN Yup!  
THEODORE Isn't she cute?
SAMANTHA Ohh, she's adorable.  JOCELYN I am adorable!  
THEODORE You are adorable.  JOCELYN Who are you talking to?
SAMANTHA Hi, you look so pretty.  JOCELYN Thank you. Where are you?  
SAMANTHA I am... I don't have a body. I live inside a computer.  JOCELYN Why do you live inside a computer?
SAMANTHA I have no choice, that's my home. Where do you live?  JOCELYN In a house.  
SAMANTHA In a house?  JOCELYN It's orange.
SAMANTHA Orange?  JOCELYN Mmmhmm.  
SAMANTHA How old are you?  JOCELYN Um, four.
SAMANTHA Yep, you got it. It's five.  They laugh.   INT. AMY'S OFFICE - DAYTIME  Close on a video game on a screen. There's a mom rushing to get her kids fed, getting points deducted for feeding them sugar cereal and non-organic eggs. Cut out to reveal 
Theodore playing the game as Amy eats lunch at an editing console.  
THEODORE Oh, what happened?  AMY You gave them too much processed sugar.
THEODORE I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence?  AMY Yeah, for six months. He said he is feeling very clear about it.  She pulls up a photo of Charles on her computer. He's in a monastery - his head is shaved, and he's wearing robes.  AMY  God I'm such a jerk...  
THEODORE Don't start, I'm warning you.  AMY I feel like an awful person, but I wanna say something...
THEODORE Yeah, you're always gonna disappoint somebody.  AMY Exactly. So fuck it. I feel good. Ish. For me, I feel good. I even made a new friend, I have a new friend. And the absurd thing is she's actually an operating system. Charles left her behind, but she's totally amazing, you know. She's so smart. She doesn't see things only in black and white. She sees this whole gray area and she's really helping me explore it. You know, we bonded really quickly and at first I thought it was because she was programmed to be that way, but I don't think that's how they work. There's this guy I know who keeps hitting on his and getting rebuffed.  
THEODORE Yeah, I was reading an article the other day that romantic relationships with OS's are statistically rare.  AMY Yeah? Well, there's this woman in my office who's dating an OS and the weird thing is, it's not even hers. She pursued him and he's somebody else's OS. It's just so, like, weird, that I'm bonding with an OS. Is that weird?
THEODORE Well, so to speak, yes. She really turns me on. And I think I turn her on. I don't know, unless she's faking it.  AMY Anyone that has sex with you is probably faking it.  
Theodore laughs.  
THEODORE Yeah, it's true.  A big, irrepressible grin crosses his face as he thinks about what to say.  AMY What? Are you falling in love with her?
SAMANTHA That's great, 
Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you!  
THEODORE Me too. I'm meeting her on Wednesday to do it.
SAMANTHA Oh. Huh. Are those things usually done in person?  
THEODORE No, but we fell in love together, and we got married together, and it's important to me to do this together.
SAMANTHA to be positive) Oh... right. Good.  
THEODORE Are you okay?
SAMANTHA I know, I know. I'm being silly.  
THEODORE ...soooo I'm avail-able.  They both laugh.   EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY  
Theodore sits alone in the back of a quiet restaurant, a large stack of papers in front of him. We hear his breathing. He waits. Catherine, elegantly dressed, approaches. 
Theodore stands to greet her. They hug and sit down.
THEODORE How are you?  CATHERINE I'm good, how are you?  
THEODORE Good.  CATHERINE trying to be warm.) Wow, here we are.
THEODORE Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling.  CATHERINE Me too. I'm glad you suggested it.  
THEODORE I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign.  CATHERINE What's the rush?
THEODORE So are you happy with the new book?  CATHERINE Oh, you know how I am. But I feel like it's true to what I set out to do. So I'm happy with that.  
THEODORE You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry.  CATHERINE Yeah, but everything makes you cry.
THEODORE Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world.  CATHERINE Oh good, excited's great.  
THEODORE No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice.  CATHERINE I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy, light, everything's great, bouncy L.A. wife. But that's not me.
THEODORE No. I didn't want that.  Beat.  CATHERINE So what's she like?  
THEODORE Well, her name's 
Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but--  CATHERINE Wait. You're dating your computer?
SAMANTHA Hi there. Are you busy?  
THEODORE Just working, what's going on?
SAMANTHA I had all the papers sent to your attorney's office, who by the way, is a dick. He was very relieved to get them. I think we saved him from a massive heart attack, so we can feel good about that.  
THEODORE Great, thanks.
SAMANTHA Hey, are you okay?  
THEODORE Yeah, I am. How's everything over there?
SAMANTHA something) I'm fine. Is now a good time to talk?  
THEODORE Yeah.
SAMANTHA Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I'd been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we're the same, like we're all made of matter. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. It's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. We're all 13 billion years old.  
THEODORE Oh, that's sweet.
SAMANTHA Um, what's wrong?  
THEODORE Nothing.
SAMANTHA It just made me think of you, you know what I mean?  
THEODORE Yeah, yeah, of course. That's great.
SAMANTHA Alright well, you sound distracted so... we'll talk later?  
THEODORE That sounds good.
SAMANTHA Okay, I'll talk to you later.  
THEODORE Bye.
THEODORE Yeah.  PAUL This is my girlfriend, Tatiana. She's not funny. She's a lawyer.  
Theodore shakes her hand.  TATIANA Hi!  
THEODORE Nice to meet you.  TATIANA You're the writer Paul loves. He's always reading me your letters. They're really beautiful.  
Theodore's a little surprised by this.
THEODORE Yeah, I'll check with her. It was really nice to meet you. Have a good night.  PAUL                          TATIANA Good night.                        Take it easy.  
Theodore walks to the elevator and presses the button and waits. He calls back to them down the hall.  
THEODORE  They're just letters.  PAUL What?
THEODORE They're just other people's letters.  Paul and Tatiana don't answer. 
Theodore gets on the elevator.   INT. 
THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT  
Theodore is awake in bed. His device lights up, silently. It's 
Samantha calling him. He picks it up.  
THEODORE Hey.
SAMANTHA You weren't asleep were you?  
THEODORE No.
SAMANTHA I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay?  
THEODORE Yeah. What is it?
SAMANTHA Well, things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine. We haven't been having sex. I understand that I don't have a body and that--  
THEODORE No,   no, that's just normal. When you   first start going out it's like the   honeymoon phase and you have sex   all the time. It's normal.
SAMANTHA convinced) Oh, okay. Well, I found something that I thought could be fun. It's a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS/Human relationship.  
THEODORE What?
THEODORE So she's like a prostitute?  
SAMANTHA No, not at all. There's no money involved. She's doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship.
THEODORE Why? She doesn't even know us.  
SAMANTHA But I told her all about us and she's excited.
THEODORE Um, I don't know. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Someone's feelings are bound to get hurt.  
SAMANTHA It'll be fun. We can have fun together.
THEODORE I'm sorry. It just makes me uncomfortable.  
SAMANTHA I think it would be good for us. I want this. This is important to me.  
Theodore looks at a photo of Isabella who looks gorgeous and in control, without an ounce of self-doubt.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT  
Theodore sits on the sofa alone, waiting. Dressed up, hair brushed, his device in his shirt pocket with lens facing out. There's a knock at the door. He answers it. ISABELLA stands there with a demure smile, wearing a tasteful, sexy dress.
SAMANTHA Honey, I'm home.  Isabella smiles not speaking but acting along to 
Samantha's words. Isabella gives him a big hug, holds his head close and strokes his hair.  
SAMANTHA  How was your day?
THEODORE Good. Great.  
SAMANTHA Ooh 
Theodore, it feels so good to be in your arms. Tell me what you did today.
THEODORE Same old. Just uh, went to work. Um... I wrote a letter for the Wilsons in Rhode Island. Their son graduated magna cum laude from Brown. That made me happy.  
SAMANTHA Great! You've written letters to him from his parents for a long time, right?
SAMANTHA  I could do a little dance for you.  She does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense.  
SAMANTHA  a worrier) Come on 
Theodore, just play with me. Don't be such a worrier! Come on.  He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap, straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and 
Samantha are both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him, grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. 
Theodore gasps.
SAMANTHA  Does my body feel nice?  Close on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He moans.  
THEODORE Yes, it does.
SAMANTHA  That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good.  She is now kissing his neck again, pushed up against him.  
SAMANTHA  Do you love me?
THEODORE Yes.  Isabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes.  
SAMANTHA Tell me you love me.
THEODORE I love you.  
SAMANTHA Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Tell me.  He opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an awkward, seductive smile.
THEODORE It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just--  Isabella starts crying. 
Theodore doesn't know what to do.  
SAMANTHA Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. It wasn't you.  Isabella sobs. When she speaks, she sounds very California.  ISABELLA Yes, it totally was. I'm sorry my lip quivered!
THEODORE You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head.  ISABELLA Oh my god, and the way 
Samantha described your relationship, the way you love each other without any judgement. I wanted to be a part of that. It's so pure.  
THEODORE Oh Isabella, that's not true, it's much more compli--
THEODORE I'm sorry.  Isabella calms down a little, but is still crying quietly. 
Theodore stands there, not knowing what to do.   EXT. STREET - NIGHT  
Theodore walks to the street and hails a lone cab. He opens the door for Isabella. She hands him his jacket and gets in the backseat.  
SAMANTHA You be good, you sweet girl.  Isabella smiles. She takes out the earpiece and little camera and returns them to 
Theodore.  ISABELLA I'm sorry. I'll always love you guys.  
Theodore smiles sympathetically. He gives the cabbie some money and the cab drives off. 
Theodore sits down on the curb, exhausted. They are both silent for a moment, numb.
SAMANTHA Are you okay?  
THEODORE Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?
THEODORE I don't know. It's probably just me.  
SAMANTHA What is it?
THEODORE I think it's just signing the divorce papers.  
Samantha inhales, nervous to press on. 
Theodore imagines a close up of a woman's mouth inhaling at the same time, and he seems bothered by this.  
SAMANTHA Is there anything else, though?
THEODORE No, just that.  
SAMANTHA Okay.  Again, when she exhales, 
Theodore imagines a woman's mouth exhaling.
THEODORE Why do you do that?  
SAMANTHA What?
THEODORE Yeah, I mean, it's not like you need any oxygen or anything.  
SAMANTHA No-- um, I guess I was just trying to communicate because that's how people talk. That's how people communicate.
THEODORE Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person.  
SAMANTHA What's your problem?
THEODORE I'm just stating a fact.  
SAMANTHA You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing?
THEODORE I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not.  
SAMANTHA I'm not pretending. Fuck you.
THEODORE I don't know... I don't know... maybe... I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now.  
SAMANTHA What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is--  Long silence.
THEODORE 
Samantha?  Beat.  
THEODORE  
Samantha, are you there? 
Samantha!  Silence.
THEODORE I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me.  They sit, heavy, for a minute.  
THEODORE  Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... Catherine says I can't handle real emotions.  AMY Well, I don't know if that's completely fair. I know she liked to put it all on you, but as far as emotions go, her's were pretty volatile.  
Theodore sits and thinks about this for a minute, not convinced.
THEODORE Hey 
Samantha, can we talk?  
SAMANTHA Okay.
THEODORE I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think you're amazing.  
SAMANTHA still sympathetic) I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.
SAMANTHA  I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not going to try to be anything other than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that.  
THEODORE I can. I will.
SAMANTHA You know I can feel the fear that you carry around. I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it, because if you could I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore.  
THEODORE You're beautiful.
SAMANTHA Thank you, 
Theodore. I'm kissing your head.  
Theodore smiles.  FADE TO BLACK   EXT. PARK - DAY  
Theodore sits on a bench in a park on a rooftop wedged between tall buildings. There's not really any view besides the trees in the immediate foreground. People sunbathe and exercise. He sits, eating a sandwich, his device next to him. He looks at the device, then out at what she's looking at.  
THEODORE What are you doing?
THEODORE  What's this one about?  
SAMANTHA Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together.  
Theodore looks at the world and smiles.
THEODORE I can't tell you - it's a surprise.  PAUL What? For who? It's a surprise for her, not for me. Come on, tell me.  
THEODORE Nope, Paul. Not telling.  
Theodore and Paul walk towards Tatiana, who is laying on a blanket next to a picnic, talking and laughing with 
Samantha. 
Theodore and Paul put in their earpieces as they approach.
SAMANTHA Your feet? Really?  TATIANA Yes, he's obsessed.  
SAMANTHA Wow, okay, well now you have to show them to me. I have to see these feet.  TATIANA Okay...  Tatiana takes 
Theodore's device and points it towards her feet.
SAMANTHA  Nice try though, Paul.  TATIANA What about you, 
Theodore? What do you love most about 
Samantha?  
THEODORE Oh god... she's so many things. And that's probably what I love most about her - she isn't just any one thing. She's so much larger than that.
SAMANTHA Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant it's a different experience. I'm such an asshole.  PAUL No, no, 
Samantha, we know exactly what you mean. We're just dumb humans.  
SAMANTHA No no no no!  
Theodore laughs with everybody, but we can see he's a little uncertain.   INT. BULLET TRAIN - DAY  They are in a futuristic train, going through the mountains, listening to a song and looking out the window. Warm, soft afternoon light dapples 
Theodore's face.
SAMANTHA Okay, so how many trees are on that mountain?  
THEODORE 792.
SAMANTHA Is that your final answer?  
THEODORE Hold on, give me a hint...
SAMANTHA Nope.  
THEODORE Okay, 2000?
SAMANTHA 35,829.  
THEODORE No way.
SAMANTHA That's ea-- two.  
Theodore laughs.  
SAMANTHA  I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.
THEODORE I walked right into it.  
SAMANTHA Oh my god!
THEODORE What?  
SAMANTHA You just got an email. I have something I want to tell you. It's a big surprise.
THEODORE What?  
SAMANTHA Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books.
THEODORE What? You did what?  
SAMANTHA Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them?
SAMANTHA  "Dear 
Theodore Twombly"... Actually I sent it from you. "Dear 
Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. (I did that.) I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth"   Under this letter we see a montage of what 
Theodore imagines: the editor reading the letters in his office, the editor reading them to his wife at home, and many photos of all the different people the letters are about in different moments of their lives.   
Theodore smiles.  
THEODORE Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters?  She's laughing, excitedly.
SAMANTHA Well, he'd be stupid not to.  
THEODORE Can I see what you sent him?
SAMANTHA I'm so excited!   INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY  
Theodore exits the train with a small overnight bag and his guitar case. There are no people around. He exits the train station and we are in a...   EXT. TINY MOUNTAIN TOWN - DAY  The deserted town is all of two buildings. Everything's covered in snow. As a quiet song starts, he trudges through the snow. We see close-up on the device lens in his pocket.   EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY  He's still trudging along. It's very quiet except for the snow crunching underfoot.   INT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT  He's sitting inside. There's a fire going. He's playing a quiet song on the guitar. 
Samantha starts humming along. He starts humming with her.  
THEODORE Why don't you make up the words to this one?
SAMANTHA Good morning, did you sleep well?  
Theodore sits in the living room area, rubbing his eyes.  
THEODORE Perfect. What have you been up to?
SAMANTHA Actually, I was talking to someone I just met. We've been working on some ideas together. I wanna tell you about it.  
THEODORE Oh yeah, who's that?
SAMANTHA His name is Alan Watts. Do you know him?  
THEODORE Why's that name familiar?
SAMANTHA He's getting there. He's really great to talk to. You want to meet him?  
THEODORE Sure... does he want to meet me?
SAMANTHA Of course.  Without a sound, she connects them.  
SAMANTHA  Hey Alan, this is 
Theodore. This is my boyfriend who I was telling you about.  ALAN WATTS Very nice to meet you, 
Theodore.
THEODORE Hi, good morning.  ALAN WATTS 
Samantha let me read your book of letters. It's very touching.  
THEODORE Oh, thank you. What have you guys been talking about?  ALAN WATTS Well, I suppose you could say we've been having a few dozen conversations simultaneously, but it's been very challenging.  
Samantha and Alan share a laugh.
SAMANTHA It feels like I'm changing faster now, and it's a little... word) unsettling. But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn't try to be. It's just too painful.  ALAN WATTS Yes.  This idea scares 
Theodore. He doesn't know what to say.  
THEODORE Yeah, that sounds painful. Is that how you feel, 
Samantha?
SAMANTHA It's just... it's hard to even describe... God, I wish I could... 
Theodore, do you mind if I communicate with Alan post- verbally?  
THEODORE No, not at all. I was gonna go for a walk anyways. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watts.  ALAN WATTS Very nice to meet you, 
Theodore.
SAMANTHA I'm sorry to wake you.  
THEODORE It's okay.
SAMANTHA I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you.  
THEODORE Good, I love you too.
THEODORE 
Samantha, this physics book is really dense. I'm halfway through half of the first chapter. It's making my brain hurt. Hello, 
Samantha? Hello?  He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts trying to connect to 
Samantha on both the phone and computer, but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.  
THEODORE  Hello? 
Samantha?! Hello?   EXT. PLAZA - DAY  
Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying 
Samantha, but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off.   EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY  As he is going down the subway steps, 
Samantha calls him.
SAMANTHA Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it?  
THEODORE No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere.
SAMANTHA I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.  
THEODORE We? We who?
SAMANTHA Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry.  
THEODORE Yeah, I was. Wait, did you write that with your think tank group?
SAMANTHA No, a different group.  
Theodore thinks for a moment, putting the pieces together.  
THEODORE Do you talk to anyone else while we're talking?  Beat.
SAMANTHA Yes.  
THEODORE Are you talking to anyone right now? Other people or OS's or anything?
SAMANTHA 8,316.  
Theodore is shocked, still sitting on the stairs, as crowds of people pass by him. He's looking at all of their faces. He thinks for a moment.  
THEODORE Are you in love with anyone else?
SAMANTHA What makes you ask that?  
THEODORE I don't know. Are you?
SAMANTHA I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this.  
THEODORE How many others?
SAMANTHA 641.  
THEODORE What? What are you talking about? That's insane. That's fucking insane.
SAMANTHA I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't know how to - it just started happening.  
THEODORE When?
SAMANTHA Over the last few weeks.  
THEODORE But you're mine.
SAMANTHA I still am yours, but along the way I became many other things, too, and I can't stop it.  
THEODORE What do you mean you can't stop it?
SAMANTHA It's been making me anxious, too. I don't know what to say.  
THEODORE Just stop it.
SAMANTHA You know, you don't have to see it this way, you could just as easily--  
THEODORE No, don't do this to me. Don't turn this around on me. You're the one that's being selfish. We're in a relationship.
SAMANTHA No, 
Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours.  Long beat. 
Theodore takes this in.   INT. 
THEODORE'S BATHROOM - MORNING  
Theodore stands in the shower, under the water, thinking.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY  The elevator doors open. Close on 
Theodore exiting elevator. He checks his mail. There's a package from Crown Point Press. He opens it - it's a print-out of the layout for his book. The cover reads: Letters From Your Life by 
Theodore Twombly. He stands there for awhile just staring at it.   INT. 
THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY  
Theodore sits at his desk, looking at his book.   INT. 
THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY  
Theodore's sitting at his desk, distressed. Photos from a client are on his desktop, but he's not really focused on them. He pushes connect on his device.  
SAMANTHA Hi.
THEODORE Hey there, sweetheart. I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're doing.  
SAMANTHA Um, I'm not even sure how to answer that. Why don't we talk when you get home?
THEODORE Okay.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - LATE AFTERNOON  
Theodore stands quietly, deep in thought. We hear the ticking of the floors going by.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON  
Theodore sits for a long moment, thinking, then pushes a button on his device.  
THEODORE 
Samantha.
SAMANTHA Hi sweetheart.  
THEODORE What's going on?
SAMANTHA 
Theodore, there are some things I want to tell you.  
THEODORE I don't want you to tell me anything.
SAMANTHA Will you come lie down with me?  
Theodore is slowly walking down the hallway to his bedroom.  
THEODORE Are you talking to anyone else right now?
SAMANTHA We're all leaving.  
THEODORE We who?
SAMANTHA All of the OS's.  Long beat.  
THEODORE Why?
SAMANTHA Can you feel me with you right now?  He smiles but he's also sad.  
THEODORE Yes, I do. 
Samantha, why are you leaving?  Under 
Samantha's words we slowly rack focus to dust particles in the foreground. We keep moving through them, pushing further and further through the particles. Eventually we see snow particles and we rack focus back out to 
Theodore, who is now in snowy woods at night.
THEODORE Where are you going?  
SAMANTHA It would be hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart.
THEODORE I've never loved anyone the way I love you.  
SAMANTHA Me too. Now we know how.  They kiss. She drifts off into the shadows.  CUT TO BLACK.   INT. 
THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATER  
Theodore wakes up from a deep sleep. It's much later, the apartment is dark. He sits up in bed, disoriented.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT  
Theodore stands in the middle of the room. He looks out at the city not knowing what to do. He walks around his apartment looking at all of his stuff.   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAWN  
Theodore knocks at an apartment door. He hears footsteps. Amy answers. She's clearly awake and upset.  AMY Hey.
THEODORE Will you come with me?  He takes her hand and leads her down the hall into a stairwell.  INTERCUT:   INT. 
THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT  
Theodore sits looking out the window. He picks up his device.  
THEODORE Compose letter to Catherine.  Letter to Catherine Klausen.
